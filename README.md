# JUMP
This repo contains the data analysis code and the report for the JUMP experiment which meant to be a mockperiment.

Main objective of the experiment is to underline the determining factors of jump distance. A jumper performs a number of standing forward jumps under different limitations like their hands being tied together or eyes being closed. Controlling all the other parametres that might effect the jump distance (like the athletics of the jumper or environmental effects), the experiment shows how these limitations effect the distance that a person can jump forward.
